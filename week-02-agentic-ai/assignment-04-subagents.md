# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

---

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer uses Haiku instead of Sonnet model because does not need deep analysis provided by Sonnet but needs more of speed.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor does not have Write in its tools because it only reads the files but cannot make changes to the files.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

This is because the tf-writer inherits the model used by the main agent in performing its task of writing Terraform files.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
